title: How to know I'm using venv Python

Several ways to know if the Python interpreter is running inside a virtual environment:

- Solution 1: use `sys.prefix` that points to the Python directory
- Solution 2 (the better way): `VIRTUAL_ENV` environment variable. When a virtual environment is activated, this is set to the venvâ€™s directory, otherwise it's None.

```python
import os
print(os.environ.get('VIRTUAL_ENV'))
```
