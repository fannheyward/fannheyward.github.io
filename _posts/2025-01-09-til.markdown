- `g?` in vim will encode the selected TEXT in [ROT13](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ROT13)
- `:let @a = @a . '@a'`, append macro call to make the macro recursive, run to the end of the file
- <https://instances.vantage.sh/>, list and compare instances of AWS EC2/RDS etc
- `fc -W` will save `history` to `~/.zsh_history`. DO NOT RUN `history -c` THAT WILL CLEAR THE HISTORY
